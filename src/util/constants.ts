export const AboutText: string = `My name is Ben Ruitenbeek, and I’m a 17-year-old Dutch software developer. I’m currently in my third year of MBO at Mediacollege Amsterdam, studying Software Development. I discovered programming when I was 13, and since then I’ve been focused on improving my skills and learning as much as I can. Skipping a grade allowed me to move through my studies faster and dedicate more time to developing practical and efficient software solutions. \n\n Outside of school, I like to relax while keeping an eye on the projects I’m currently working on. Whenever I spot a problem, I make sure to fix it as quickly as possible. This approach has helped me stay engaged with my work and continually improve my skills. In the future, I would like to continue my studies in Cyber Security, where I hope to apply my technical skills to build secure and reliable systems.`;
